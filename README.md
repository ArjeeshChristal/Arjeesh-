🚀 Arjeesh Christal – Aerospace Nerd With Too Many Side Quests

Hey there! I’m Arjeesh, a B.Tech Aerospace Engineer who thought “why just fly drones when you can make them smarter than your Wi-Fi?”
If it’s got wings, propellers, thrusters, or a PCB I can fry—chances are I’ve built, broken, and rebuilt it.

✈️ What I Actually Do (Mostly Without Sleep)

🛸 Autonomous Drones
Built semi-autonomous and fully autonomous drones that can map, detect obstacles, and maybe take over the world (if you’re not careful).

Stereo vision ✅

SLAM ✅

Pixhawk + Raspberry Pi wizardry ✅

Chaos ✅

🔥 Supersonic Stuff
Designing Mach 3 supersonic nozzles because “fast enough” is boring.

Hybrid design approach with Method of Characteristics + CFD tuning.

Nerdy fluid dynamics equations included for free.

🧠 AI + Robotics = DroneX
YOLO-powered aerial surveillance platform that can find people, vehicles, and probably your lost cat.

Apache Kafka & Spark plans (because we love scalability).

Built for disaster response, SAR ops, and future swarms.

🛠 Hackathon Chaos Master

Modular drone designs with hardware/software-defined everything.

Full-stack nerd: Flask backends, React frontends, Leaflet maps, and custom telemetry pipelines.

⚡ Tech Superpowers

Things I pretend to know but actually use Stack Overflow for:

C++ / Python / ROS / MAVLink / WebRTC

SLAM, Kalman Filters, Vision-Based Navigation

Ansys simulations that melt GPUs faster than engines

DroneKit, ArduPilot SITL, Gazebo

Jetson Nano sorcery + Raspberry Pi hacking

3D printing drone parts at 3 AM

🏆 Things I’m Weirdly Proud Of

Crashed fewer drones this year than last year.

Made a drone fly autonomously on Mars (in simulation, don’t @ me NASA).

IEEE Karunya Vice Chair, which sounds fancy but mostly means I run on caffeine.

Built a website that streams live drone feeds with ML detection… from a literal drone.

🧩 Side Quests

Supersonic nozzle research

Swarm robotics experiments

Dual-mode drones (air + underwater because why not?)

Turning random sensors into something useful (or explosive, who knows)

🎯 TL;DR

I’m building the future of autonomous aerospace systems while breaking stuff along the way.
If you’re here for polished, boring code—sorry, wrong repo.
If you’re here for messy innovation and drones that think for themselves—welcome aboard.

🔥 Fun fact: My Git commits have more crashes than my drones
